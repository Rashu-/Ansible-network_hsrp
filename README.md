# Network hsrp configuration

Ansible role that configures hsrp for a network device interface. 

The configuration of the role is done so that it shouldn't be necessary to modify the role for any configuration.
All settings can be configured by changing role parameters or by declaring new config as variable.

Please report any issues or send PR.

nxos specific:
Feature hsrp has to be enabled. SVI must exist before using this. Cannot be configured on loopbacks, MD5 works only with v2.
## Examples

```yaml
---

- name: Example of how to create a vlan interface with hsrp
  hosts: switches
    vars:
      interfaces:
        Vlan
          11:
            hsrp:
              group: 11
              state: present
              preempt: enabled
              preempt_delay_min: 240
              delay_reload: 180
              priority: 130
              auth: true                            # set to true if you want to configure hsrp authentication using the key_chain defined below
              key_chain: hsrp                           # has to be defined if auth is true
              version: 2                          # role default version 2
              vip: 11.11.11.1                      # if vip is not defined it uses the first IP in the ipv4_address subnet defined for the interface
  roles:
    - ansible-network_hsrp


  

```

## Role variables

```yaml
# Define the hsrp details for interfaces to be configured (see README for examples)
